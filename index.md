I am Tianyuan (Noah) Zhou. Currently I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at Department of Statistics, University of Virginia. My research interest is mainly about statistical learning.

#### Word Embedding Research                                                   
Co-Supervisor: Prof. João Sedoc from Johns Hopkins University.
•	Theoretically showed that the performances on downstream Natural Language Processing tasks of the aligned word embeddings depend on the isotropy of the target embedding;
•	Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the aligned word embeddings’ performance, including word2vec, GloVe, FastText, Latent Semantic Analysis, Eigenwords, Dependency word Embedding; 
•	Published a paper [Getting in shape: word embedding subspaces]{https://jrodu.github.io/files/IJCAI_2019_Word_Embedding_Subspaces.pdf} in International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI).

# Working Experience
Before coming to University of Virginia, I have worked for Solutionlab Co. Ltd, a start-up in consulting, as lead data scientist, from Oct 2014 to Mar 2018. Here are a part of my projects. 

#### Consumer Insight High Definition (CIHD)
A system that predicted consumer profiles using broadband internet data. 
*	Developed a learning model to leverage a combination of manual feature construction and L2-regularized Logistic Regression to predict demographic profiles of online users;
* Proposed and performed Sigmoid Normalization and Importance Factor Evaluation as feature engineering to improve accuracy; 
*	Achieved an accuracy rate greater than 75%, 5% better than the state-of-art results published by Tencent; 
*	Companies adopting this system: PepsiCo. Inc., P&G, Nestle, Maxwell House, Estee Lauder, LG, Fonterra, Starcom Media Group, Lvmama and Hainan Airlines.

#### DIStribution Planning Optimization (DisPO)                                     
A system that used GPS data to index and evaluate different locations on a map.
*	Proposed and implemented a new method DisPO, which is a variant of the PageRank algorithm; 
*	DisPO’s results nearly doubled performance-index compared with original PageRank algorithm, which measures the correlation between the importance index and the real estate price of different locations; 
*	Companies adopting this system: PepsiCo. Inc., Samsung and Giti.

#### Target Audience Finder (TA Finder)                                            
A system used survey data to help companies target consumers and understand their behavior, adopted by Eral.
*	Designed and implemented a clustering model specific to this task. Under this model, the distance between each pair of samples is well-defined, and t-SNE is used as the main dimensionality reduction and visualization technique; 
*	Achieved the best consumer segmentation known to Eral, evident from the large number of features used and the high correlation of the behavior inside each cluster.
